main.ts is the entry point for an angular application.[it is mentioned in angular.json file in options main it can be any name]

index.html is the main html file whihc will be served to the user.[it is mentioned in angular.json file in options index it can be any name]


mono-repo-
	create multiple application and deploy multiple application
	it makes easy to share the code within the project

to bootstrap a class we need atleast 1 root module
the execution of angular project-
	first main.ts > bootstrapModule, it has AppModule >

appModule -
	will have
	all the components,
	third party library,
	BrowserModule is a library available from angular
	imports-
		any angular module needs to be imported will be added in imports array
	declarations-
		any angular directive,component,pipes are added in declaration array

@NgModule decorator
	modifies the behaviour of the class
	it gives all the information about component or directives that are to be used

Bootstrap
	requires which component needs to load first



Components are views thatll be render to the users

@Component({
	selectors:'app-root' //custome html tags to render anywhere in the application
	templateUrl:"./app.component.html" //for the html template.
	styleUrls:'/app.component.scss

})

the app-root ['app' can be changed to custome prefixes in angular.json > prefix]

Template Syntax
	Interpolation-  {{name}} render data value from the ts file
	Property Binding - [innerText]='variable' assigns the property values

Directives-
	Used to change behaviour and appearence of the DOM element
	types-
		Structural Directive - can modify DOM [ngif,ngfor,ngswitch] it has '*'
		Attribute Directive - cannot add or remove the element from the DOM
	Built-in Directive
		*ngIf -removes DOM element based on condition
		*ngFor - access the array values into template
		*ngSwitch - <div *ngSwitch="role">
  			<div *ngSwitchCase="'admin'">Admin</div>
  			<div *ngSwitchCase="'user'">User</div>
  			<div *ngSwitchDefault>Default</div>
			</div>

Pipes-
	Used for data transformation [ the og value wont change, only value displayed will chnage]
	date,uppercae,lowercase,titlecase,currency[default is dollar] , percentage , json, slice [ |slice : 0:2 displays what number of data to be shown], async

\\
First constructor is called then ngOnInIt.
constructor must only be used for injection.
lifeCycle Hooks
	ngOnInIt- called at the initialise of component
	ngOnChanges - whenevr we get new values we can get from onchanges b/w parent and child
	ngDoCheck - checks changes everytime
	ngAfterViewInit - checked after the view is initialised completely [view child be accessed only on afterviewinint]
	AfterContentInit - after the content is initialised [the ng content #variable will be used to manipulte the data]
	ngDestroy - Used to destroy the memory consuming data from the component



Component Communication-
	From parent to child
		@Input decorator in child
		<app-child [the input variable name] =" the parent ts value to pass"></app-child>

		@Output decorator in child
		 - @Output() roomSelected = new EventEmitter<RoomList>();
			    this.roomSelected.emit(room);
		in parent
	<app-child (the output variable name) =" function($event)"></app-child>


@ViewChild- creates an instance of a component [incase of 1 instanse]
	- can get the changes in AfterViewInIt()
		@ViewChild(HeaderComponent, { static: true })headerComponent!: HeaderComponent;


@ViewChildren

ng-template -
		A tag which will not render anything, but can be helpful redering other compnents


Dependency Injection [Dependency Injection Providers DIP]
	It can be a class or object that cna be injected into the component

Services- Business logics

DIP types-
	Class based Providers -passing classes as service
	Value Providers - passing values as the service[providers in app module providing the constant variable]
	Factory-

Service FIle contents-
	@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root', \\ it registers itself into the root module ie app module
})

NullInjector - checks if the service is available or not

Resolution Modifier-
	@Self()
	@Optional()
	@Host()


Angular HTTP / Observables
	import HTTPCLIENTMODULE into app-module

rxjs is a push based data
Observables are stream of data to wchich we can subscribe
	observable has closed ,error, next methods
	internally the observer will observe the values, so incase if value change happens the subscriber will get the updated value


RxJs Operators-
whenever using streams or rxjs for the data use $ ex- getRooms$
	shareReply - used when the api data never changes and multiple calls are made for the data, this will minimise the api call and render the data, as the data is cached.
 ex- roomListFunc$ = this.http.get<RoomList[]('api/rooms').pipe(shareReplay(1));

async Pipi-
	  rooms$ = this.roomsService.roomListFunc$;
	rooms$ is of the subscription type
	in html we can use |async to render the data without subscription
which will be destroye
ex in html-
	<div *ngIf="rooms$ | async as rooms">
  <app-rooms-list
    [roomList]="rooms"
    [title]="title"
    (roomSelected)="selectedRoom($event)"
  ></app-rooms-list>
</div>

catchError- handling errors
	create a Subject
  error$: Subject<string> = new Subject<string>();
 rooms$ = this.roomsService.roomListFunc$.pipe(
    catchError((err) => {
      console.log(err);
      this.error$.next(err.message);
      return of([]);
    })
  );
whenever the catchError catches the error block, the error$ subject is hit by next()
  getErrors$ = this.error$.asObservable();
this will subscribe to the observable
and on html if we want to access the error block
<h3>{{getErrors$ |async}}</h3>
we have to use the async pipe


Map Operator-[modifying the stream ]
	we can get modified data from the existing stream without subscribing to it ex-   roomsCount$ = this.roomsService.roomListFunc$.pipe(map((res) => res.length));



Http Interceptor and App_initializer-
	Interceptor- An intermediar which is in between client and server, it can also listen to the requests. [it can modify request and even the response]
	Interceptor.ts-
		HttpInterceptor requires interceptor function
set headers- request = request.clone({
      setHeaders: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        token: '1234567899876',
      },
    });
			next.handle(request) //sends request to the server
	In App module.ts
		providers:[ {
      		provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, //http_interceptor is a token
   		useClass: RequestInterceptor, // tells to add interceptor class to the existing ones built in angular[it will always be sequential]
		multi: true,
    		}],


App_Initializer- allows to intercept before the application starts/acts as an entry point. The service is called before the application is initalised
	on initservice.ts-
	 config!: any;
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
 	 init() {
   	 return this.http
   	   .get('../assets/config.json')
   	   .pipe(tap((config) => (this.config = config)));
 	 }
to initialise , itll be done on app.module.ts as -
function initFactory(initservice: InitService) {
  return () => initservice.init();
}
function before the @NgModule
and needs to be initialised on provider
		{
      provide: APP_INITIALIZER,
      useFactory: initFactory,
      deps: [InitService],
      multi: true,
    },


Routers
RouterModule provides all the functionality route requires
<a [routerLink]="'room'">rooms</a>
if we use href the whole page gets refreshed
when the routerlink is called the router removes the existing component with required compnent

Activated Routes- needs subscription/provides updated values
snapshot - doenst need subscription, the value chnaged on the same view doesnt reflect

Router Service- navigate programatically
	Router.navigateByUrl('')




Forms
-Template Driven Forms
-Reactive Forms

form states - pristine, dirty, valid, invalid, touched

Template Driven Forms-
	import FormsModule in app module imports
<form #roomsForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="addRoom()">
  <div class="form-group">
<input class="form-control" type="text" name="roomType" id="" placeholder="roomtype" [(ngModel)]="room.roomType" required #roomtype>
</div>
</form>
 #roomsForm is a template refrence that can be used for form validation
#roomType is a field reference for field validation

Custom Directive with Forms- [helper function used to manipulate DOM]
	directives are similar to component but theyll never have a template

Router Guards

  CanActivate
  Canload
  CanActivateChild
  CanDeactivate
  guard returns
  route:ActivatedRouteSnapshot
  state: RouterStateSnapshot as Observable or UrlTree or promisses

@Injectable({providn:'root'})
  canActivate(route:ActivatedRouteSnapshot
  state: RouterStateSnapshot as Observable or UrlTree or promisses){
    return true // the route depends on this
  }

CanActivateChild - the guard is set to the child routes of the parent component
canLoad() - checks if the guard can load the partiular route [for lazy loaded component itll check ]



Reactive Forms -[gives more control on forms]
1) import ReactiveFormsModule from '@angular/forms' into your App Module Imports
2) create an instance of FormGroup and pass it's values to the constructor
3) add Validators to each FormControl
4) use ngModel directive to bind data to input fields
5) Create FormArray using new FormArray([...])
6) Use push method to add items dynamically
